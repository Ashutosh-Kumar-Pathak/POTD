Question - 162. Find Peak Element

        A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

       Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.

       You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.


You must write a solution in O(log(m * n)) time complexity.

Example 1: 
     Input :
        nums = [1,2,3,1]
     Output: 
        2

     Explanation: 
          3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.

Time Complexity: O(log n)
Space Complexity: O(1)  

Constraints:   
     1 <= nums.length <= 1000
     -2^31 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1
     nums[i] != nums[i + 1] for all valid i.
